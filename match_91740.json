Salt/Gurbaz giving brisk starts at the top, Starc stepping up in the playoffs and the Knight Riders' linchpins - Narine and Russell - being consistent. It wasn't just the overseas players, even the Indian players made vital contributions - Venkatesh Iyer, Varun Chakaravarthy, the uncapped pace duo of Harshit Rana and Vaibhav Arora, Ramandeep's little cameos and his fielding.

It was a bit of a tricky wicket. If we got 160, it would have felt we were in the game. Didn't feel like a 200+ wicket. Well short, maybe a few extra runs would have given us a chance. So many (positives), the style that the the guys played particularly with the bat. Takes a lot of skill to not only get 250 but also three times. It takes real, you are putting yourself out there a fair bit. I loved how brave the guys were. In high-pressure situations, they took the game on.

The backing of the support staff, especially GG just saying - \"go there and enjoy it, just try to win a few games for the team. I am not asking you to do the entire season, but just a few games.\" That was very good advice. Salty played an incredible season. We missed him but Gurbaz came in and filled that role.

Great to contribute personally, but the fact we had everyone contribute throughout has been a big part of the success. We lost the toss and got to use the ball first. Having watched the game a few nights ago here, not really sure what the wicket was going to do. We spoke about adapting to the conditions. Shreyas was fantastic with the way he used his bowlers and his fields, has been all season, so credit to him there. The bowling unit showed all the skills they have, the quicks and the spinners, their ability to adapt to find wicket-taking balls. that's what you need in finals. There's been jokes about the money.

I missed that game with a cut on my finger, I felt that my rhythm was building up being back into T20 cricket after a fair while, so thankfully that has been the case and got back into rhythm - the intensity and how quickly you need to adapt in T20 to conditions or how the batting team goes about it.

This is the third final at this venue and there have been high scores in both the previous games. Not a lot of spin, but significant bounce. Unconventional\u00a0shots, horizontal\u00a0bat shots is what the batters will look to do against spin. The groundsmen\u00a0have assured that B0$, say B1$, in their pitch report.",

        "comms": "B0$ - It has been a collective effort from the Knight Riders and they've got contributions from the unlikeliest sources as well. Sunil Narine was back as an opener and he's their leading run-scorer with 482 runs. Phil Salt was brought in as Jason Roy's replacement and he finished with 435 runs. As many as four others topped at least 200+ runs. In the bowling front, as many as 6 players took 10 or more wickets. A complete team effort and it's no wonder that they were easily the best team of the season. On the other hand, the Sunrisers have depended heavily on their powerful batting line-up. With 567 runs and a SR of 192.2, Travis Head tops the charts. Five others have gone past at least 200+ runs, but only three bowlers have entered double digits in the wickets column. But tonight's completely different - one good batting performance or one good bowling spell could lead to a title dash.",

They suffered only 3 losses and haven't been beaten by any team for exactly one month. On the other hand, the Sunrisers had to wait until their 13th game to confirm a playoff position and then won their last match to secure a top-2 spot. In the big scheme of things, they've never beaten the Knight Riders this season. They were beaten by a 4-run margin in a close opening encounter, but there was nothing close to their hammering in Qualifier 1.",
