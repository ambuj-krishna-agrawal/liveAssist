USA as I previously mentioned will be over the moon to grab a series win against a full-member team while Bangladesh would be bitterly disappointed. But still cricket ahead for both these sides before they go into the big event. We close our coverage here of this game. We will be back with more cricket soon. See you and till then don't forget to take care. Bye.",

USA can be saved criticism for this loss as they are on a high. And they made changes to this game to give their reserve players a chance. Bangladesh with Mustafizur set the tone with the ball and the target was chased down without loss by the openers. The real Bangladesh turned up today and that gave USA no chance. The target of 105 was never going to be enough and Tanzid and Sarkar helped themselves to good morale-boosting knocks ahead of the T20 World Cup. While the USA will be over the moon with the series win, Bangladesh will know that they have a lot of work to do ahead of the World Cup. They would be shocked and gutted to lose this series, when in their minds they would have come here thinking this is going to be an easy series. Stay tuned for the presentations...",
