Been 10 long years since the Knights last won that title. It's not the end of SRH's journey though as they will face the winner of tomorrow's game in Qualifier 2. Expecting the Eliminator (B0$) game to be much more exciting than tonight's clash. RCB have been on a roll and have won six games on the trot. Will they make it 7 in a row against Rajasthan Royals? We shall find out tomorrow. For now, it's goodbye from B1$ and B2$. Peace out!",

We needed to pick early wickets and get into their middle-order. The way Head and Abhishek have been playing thoughout the tournament, they like width and free their arms. We just tried to swing the ball and not provide them width. Bowl stump to stump and tried the hard length. The spinners were effective and the whole bowling department was great. Got lucky I guess (on taking Head's wicket), was nice to see his back early, not always the case. We have been playing against each other in recent times. They (Arora and Harshit) are exciting to watch and are talented, they are skillful. It's good to see how hard they train. Harshit has been phenomenal this year. Our bowling attack has been great, it's hard to single anyone out. As an older and overseas player, it's good to see. No doubt they'll take many wickets in the IPL and for India as well.",

When you travel so much. It's important to stay in the present. Today was the day we had to maximise, we did it and that's what we thrive on. I think the way every bowler stood up to this occasion, the way they came in and took wickets, that was imperative. The attitude and approach of all bowlers was to take wickets and they did. When you have a variety in the bowling line-up, it's mesmerising. They have been true in terms of their work ethics, hopefully we keep performing. It was Gurbaz's first game and he gave an impactful start. We had to make sure we carry forward the same run rate. I don't know tamil, but I understand. Venky speaks in tamil, I reply in hindi (talking about the communication between him and Venkatesh Iyer). We need to be in our zone in the final and make sure we give our best.",

Tripathi continued to play well from the other end and scored a fine fifty but a needless run-out sent him packing. The Impact sub flopped and the wickets continued to tumble. Chakravarthy once again bowled a top spell to choke SRH. Cummins played a good cameo but 159 is below-par on a surface which is pretty good for batting.

        "comms": "B0$ by B1$ \\n \\nAhmedabad has been burning and boiling, with the mercury soaring above 45 degrees celsius lately, but amusingly enough, that may not be all bad news. With a slew of recent Indian Premier League matches affected by rain, the current trend of scorching heat is unlikely to be unwelcomed by those associated with the IPL. Ironically, it may offer a refreshing relief to the two remaining teams at the venue. \\n \\nThe weather forecast for both Tuesday and Wednesday, when Qualifier 1 and the Eliminator will be played, is for more of the same sweltering heat, ensuring the matches proceed without interruption. According to the local Meteorological Department, the weather will be 'hot with plenty of sun' - a massive understatement of the season. The heat has been both infernal and searing. But just try asking the Kolkata Knight Riders, who experienced two consecutive washouts, including one at the Narendra Modi Stadium on May 13. They may not mind the heat. \\n \\nHeading into a crucial fixture, the Knight Riders, two-time champions who finished at the top of the points table for the first time in 17 seasons, are short on match practice, having last played a full 40-over game on May 5. This could be a concern for Shreyas Iyer's side, who have engineered and pioneered a new approach to the IPL, almost similar to the style of their opponents, Sunrisers Hyderabad, in Qualifier 1. Both teams have redefined the game with a high-risk, no-holds-barred, take-no-prisoners attitude. \\n \\nThus, it will be a clash of two bold, fearless, in-form teams with a slight edge tilted towards the Hyderabad side, who are also looking for their third IPL championship. Kolkata have their season's regular opener, Phil Salt, who combined well with other opener Sunil Narine, missing since the Englishman has left for home for national duties. Narine may partner Rahmanullah Gurbaz in the game. The Afghan is yet to hit a ball in a game this season. \\n \\nOn the other hand, SRH's go-for-broke opening combination of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma is very much intact. Strange things have certainly happened in cricket, particularly in the IPL, but the success or failure of the opening combinations of the sides could determine the result of the game. \\n \\nThen there is this bowling factor that gives Pat Cummins's side some advantage. The Hyderabad team has largely depended on its pacers - T Natarajan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Cummins himself with Jaydev Unadkat and Marco Jansen to fall back on - and the Narendra Modi Stadium has mostly aided the pacers. The Knight Riders' arsenal has been their spinners, chiefly Narine and Varun Chakaravarthy. \\n \\nA big plus for Hyderabad has been that Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who opens the attack, had been off colour initially but has found his mojo in the second half of the league while the Knight Riders have not exactly had their spearhead, Mitchell Starc, firing on all cylinders. Kolkata will need Starc (12 wickets in 11 innings), the costliest buy in the IPL history, to come to the party. If that's not enough, KKR need to be wary of the happy memories that Cummins and Head have at this venue - of winning the ODI World Cup last year. \\n \\nBut the only issue that may not work for SRH is the neutrality in the stands. Cummins had famously said before the World Cup final last year that nothing is more satisfying than silencing 1.3 lakh people. There may be as many people on Tuesday night as well, but they may not support the opposition as fervently as they did on November 19, 2023. \\n \\nB2$ Kolkata Knight Riders vs SunRisers Hyderabad, IPL 2024, May 21, 19:30 IST \\n \\nB3$ Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad \\n \\nB4$ It is not a do-or- die game but neither team wants to be in that situation as a defeat will put them there. With the pitch expected to assist the batters, it will be a high-scoring game with the captain winning the toss choosing to field, as most captains have done this season. \\n \\nB5$ KKR 17 - 9 SRH. The Knight Riders have been even more dominating since 2020, having won seven of their nine face-offs. The playoffs records of the two sides are almost similar, with KKR winning eight and losing five while SRH have won 5 and lost six. \\n \\nB6$ \\n \\nB7$ \\n \\nB8$ All players, barring Phil Salt, are available. \\n \\nB9$ Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma are among the rare few batters who have enjoyed an upperhand in the battle against Sunil Narine. The veteran spinner could be held back to be utilised in the middle and late overs in a bid to control Heinrich Klassen, who enjoys a favourable matchup against the other KKR spinner - Varun Chakravarthy. \\n \\nAndre Russell has dismissed Abhishek twice in 10 balls, and conceded only 11 runs. Don't be surprised if the West Indian has an early go against the in-form southpaw \\n \\nB10$ Rahamanullah Gurbaz (wk), Sunil Narine, Angkrish Raghuvanshi/Nitish Rana, Shreyas Iyer (c), Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh , Mitchell Starc, Harshit Rana, Varun Chakaravarthy [Impact substitute: Vaibhav Arora] \\n \\nB11$ \\n \\nB8$ They have a clean slate on this front \\n \\nB9$ Andre Russell hasn't enjoyed a high-scoring rate in Ahmedabad, striking at just under 140 in four innings at the venue.
